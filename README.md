*Iâ€™m all about turning complicated IT stuff into easy-to-use solutions.*
### About Me
From nutrition and food science through to biotech R&D and now tech, my career has been about breaking down complex processes and enhancing decision-making with data analysis and critical thinking. My work, driven by scientific rigor and a knack for tech innovation, focuses on creating practical solutions.  And, echoing a cornerstone principle from the scientific world: if itâ€™s not documented, it didnâ€™t happen."  
I love writing technical documentations except for HR use cases.
